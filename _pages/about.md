Hello, I'm a high school student planning on studying information security in college. I'm interested in a whole lot of random things. In my free time, I like to run, draw, and journal.

*The Prince of Tennis* happens to be a mediocre but beloved anime that I find hilarious. It says nothing about my tennis abilities.
